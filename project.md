## Overview

The goals of the final project are to learn new concepts, gain hand-on experience, and to potentially make an impact.
Please follow the following steps:

1. Form a team of 2--3 persons.
2. Think about a project idea and write a proposal.
3. Give a 10-min Milestone Presentation.
4. Submit your code, video, and report.

## Grading

* Idea novelty/recency: 20%
* Implementation: 30%
* Reproducibility: 20%
* Milestone Presentation: 5%
* Final Video: 10%
* Final Report: 15%
 

## Deadlines

* Proposal: Feb 14th.
* Milestone Presentation: Mar 20th
* Final Submission: April 20th

## Project Ideas

It is preferred to come up with your own idea. 
To evaluate whether your project is good or not, please ask yourself the following three questions:

  * Is it important? (i.e., what impacts can your project make?)
  * Is it challenging? (i.e., does a naive solution work very well?)
  * What can I learn by doing the project? (i.e., new tools, new techniques, new domain knowledge, new methodologies).

A good project should be important, be challenging, and be able to push you to learn something that you don't know before.


A project idea may be one of these categories:
1. Reproducing Attacks and Defenses. Examples:
  * DNS Rebinding Attacks
  * SDN-related Attacks
  * Bypassing Virtualization/Sandboxing
  * Side-channel Attacks
2. Reproducing research papers (related to security)
  * Examples mentioned in the class
3. Implementing security-related tools
4. New research ideas
* New attack/defense 
* Security issues in serverless/container platforms
* Are vNICs secure?
* Detecting malicious IoT behavior (large-scale, distributed env.)
* Attacks based on traffic analysis, e.g., Website fingerprinting
* Detecting caching policies in web/video servers
* Security of self-driving vehicles
