## HTTP request smuggling <span class="badge badge-important">Attack</span>
The project reproduces the HTTP request smuggling attack and possible defences. 
This family of attacks takes advantage of how a front and back end reads requests differently, and 
reuses residual bytes that are left by previous requests.

## Detecting and repairing control flow hijacking attacks <span class="badge badge-success">Defense</span> <span class="badge badge-warning">Tool</span>
The project reproduces a research paper to (1) detect control hijacking attacks that exploit control sensitive data
(e.g., function pointer, return address), and (2) repair the affected memory by using logging and tree traversal (function call tree).

Work is done by Luoxi Meng; Xiyu Zhang.

## IDS deception using Generative Adversarial Networks <span class="badge badge-important">Attack</span>
