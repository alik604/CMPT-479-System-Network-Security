The milestone presentations of the final project are listed in this page. These presentations took place on March 20th.

## 1. ROPHunter 
The project implements a program to find ROP (return-oriented programming) gadgets. 
Another goal is to launch ROP-based attacks using the "hunted" gadgets.

Work is done by Kattie Sepehri; Leo Goldberg; Samantha Yu.

 
## 2. Light commands 
The project reproduces the light command attack, which is a vulnerability of MEMS microphones that allows an attacker to inject an
inaudible and invisible command using light. These MEMS microphones are being used in many devices. 
This means that most voice assistants such as Google Home, Siri, and Alexa, are vulnerable.

Work is done by DJ Olaiya; Jasdeep Gill; Patrick Klassen.


## 3. Detecting and repairing control flow hijacking attacks
The project reproduces a research paper to (1) detect control hijacking attacks that exploit control sensitive data
(e.g., function pointer, return address), and (2) repair the affected memory by using logging and tree traversal (function call tree).

Work is done by Luoxi Meng; Xiyu Zhang.


## 4. DNS rebinding attack for IoT devices
The project reproduces the DNS rebinding attack and possible defences.

Work is done by Jiangnan Yan; Sean Mawhinney; Phu Khang Bui.


## 5. Automatic detection of DDoS attacks
The project uses a learning approach to detect DDoS attacks on victim networks.

Work is done by Omar Mossad; Parham Yassini.

## 6. IDS deception using Generative Adversarial Networks
The project trains a generative adversarial network that is capable of taking a real network attack and modifying some of its
non-essential features in such a way as to confuse an IDS into believing it to be normal traffic.
[<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/milestone/Group06_IDS_Deception_using_GANs.pdf">slides</a>]

Work is done by Borys Bryndak; Allan Chang.

## 7. HTTP request smuggling
The project reproduces the HTTP request smuggling attack and possible defences. 
This family of attacks takes advantage of how a front and back end reads requests differently, and 
reuses residual bytes that are left by previous requests. 
[<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/milestone/Group07_HTTP_Request_Smuggling.pdf">slides</a>]

Work is done by Choongmin Bae; Amanda Pak; James Mctaggart.

## 8. Clickjacking Attacks using Cross Site Scripting
The project reproduces a family of Clickjacking attacks that exploits XSS vulnerability. 
It also considers implementing the defenses and studying the impact of different HTTP versions.
[<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/milestone/Group08_Clickjacking.pdf">slides</a>]

Work is done by Anna Rabatich; Anthony Nguyen; Scott Hetland.

## 9. Virtual Private Network
The project implements VPN server and client from scratch. 
In addition to basic VPN functionality, the project goal is to scale the VPN server implementation to support multiple concurrent clients.

Work is done by Sijie Yu; Yufei Zhang; Honghui Wang.
